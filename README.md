A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.
Can be found on telegram as [Phoenix](https://t.me/).

The Support group can be reached out to at [TG BOT SUPPORT](https://t.me/TGBOTSUPPORT), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available. 

## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):

# How to setup
Note: This instruction set is just a copy paste from marie, note that [TG BOT SUPPORT](https://t.me/TGBOTSUPPORT) aims to handle support for Phoenix and now how to setup your own fork, if you find this bit confusing/tough to understand then we recommend you ask a dev, kindly avoid asking how to setup the bot instance in the support chat, it aims to help our own instance of the bot. 

## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python 3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which are ordered by default in 3.6.
